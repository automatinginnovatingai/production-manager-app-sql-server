# 🧱 Production Manager App SQL Server– Offline Payroll & Job Tracker (.exe)

This repository contains documentation for the Production Manager App SQL Server — a closed-source Windows application designed for small production teams to manage job entries, payroll, and material usage entirely offline.

The Production Manager App was built to modernize workflows in the construction industry—specifically within fiberglass insulation. After witnessing firsthand how companies rely on paper-heavy, manual processes to handle installer paperwork, I saw an opportunity to streamline operations.
This app replaces inefficient routines with a secure, offline  solution that automates payroll calculations, centralizes job data, and generates Excel reports—no cloud dependency, no wasted time, and no paper trails. It’s designed to bring real-world construction workflows into the future of tech, without compromising operational safety or control.

## 🔐 Key Features

- Offline-first `.exe` app with no cloud dependencies
- Secure login with salted + hashed credentials
- Weekly payroll calculation based on:
  - Square footage × rate
  - Bags installed × piece rate
  - Hourly wage
- Auto-splitting pay across multiple employees per job
- Full job entry interface with builder, model, lot/block, and insulation specs
- Auto-export to Excel with per-employee sheets grouped by week
- SQL Server database connection with smart cleanup and de-duplication
- Automatic version checking and update prompts

## 🧩 License Enforcement

The `.exe` is encrypted and gated by Gumroad license validation.  
- Users must enter a valid license key on first launch  
- License keys are verified via Gumroad’s API  
- Invalid or revoked keys restrict access  
- No backend session store—validation is stateless and secure
